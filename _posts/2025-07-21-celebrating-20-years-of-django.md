This year marks a remarkable milestone: the 20th anniversary of Django, the web framework that has empowered developers and organizations around the world since its first public release in 2005\. From its humble beginnings as an internal project to becoming a cornerstone of the Python ecosystem, Django’s journey is a testament to the power of open source, collaboration, and community spirit.

Django’s philosophy—*the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines*—remains as relevant today as it was two decades ago. With over 400 releases, countless contributors, and a thriving ecosystem of packages, Django continues to set the standard for pragmatic, secure, and scalable web development.

## **The Heartbeat of Our Commitment: DjangoCon US**

At the Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA), we are proud to steward [DjangoCon US](https://2025.djangocon.us), the flagship conference for Django enthusiasts in North America.

Since its inception, DjangoCon US has brought together developers, educators, and innovators for a week of learning, sharing, and connection. Each year, the conference features:

* Inspiring talks and tutorials from community leaders and newcomers alike

* Hands-on sprints to advance Django and its ecosystem

* Opportunities to network, mentor, and collaborate

* A strong commitment to diversity, inclusion, and accessibility

DjangoCon US is more than just a conference—it’s a celebration of the people and ideas that make Django special. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting your journey, DjangoCon US is a place to grow, give back, and find your community.

## **Our Commitment to the Future**

As we celebrate Django’s 20th birthday, DEFNA reaffirms our mission to support and grow the Django community for years to come. We are dedicated to:

* **Fostering education and outreach** through events, grants, and mentorship

* **Supporting diversity and inclusion** at every level of our organization and events

* **Empowering the next generation** of Django developers and leaders

* **Ensuring DjangoCon US remains accessible, welcoming, and impactful** for all

We believe that the strength of Django lies in its community. By nurturing connections, sharing knowledge, and championing open source values, we can ensure Django continues to thrive for the next 20 years and beyond.

## **Join Us on the Journey**

Whether you’ve been with Django since the beginning or are just discovering its possibilities, we invite you to be part of our story. Attend [DjangoCon US](https://2025.djangocon.us), volunteer, share your expertise, or simply connect with fellow enthusiasts. Together, we can build a brighter, more inclusive future for Django and the web.

**Happy 20th anniversary, Django! Here’s to many more years of innovation, collaboration, and community.**

*With love, Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA), stewards of DjangoCon US and champions of Django community.*
