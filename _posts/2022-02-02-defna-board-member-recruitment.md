Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA) is looking for another board member. We have an eight member board; last year one of our board members stepped down. We are looking for a new board member, interested in growing the DjangoCon US community.

Board membership takes, on average, about five hours per month performing the following functions:

* Attend the monthly board meeting
* Participate in the grant applications review process
* Use DEFNA's social media channels to communicate about DEFNA
* Come up with new and clever ways for DEFNA to fulfill our mission

If you'd like to be considered for the board, drop us a note at hello@defna.org, and let us know:

* What interests you about being on the board
* Your current/prior community involvement (it's okay if you're newâ€”we need everyone to participate!)
* Any particular interests you have (grants committee, corporate filings, corporate treasurer, etc.)
* Any ideas you have for expanding DEFNA's reach in the OSS community
* Anything else you'd like us to know about you as a potential board member

Please email your information to us by February 21st at 6:00 PM Pacific Time. We'll contact you if we need more details. We'll make our decision and reply to everyone by end-of-day March 4th.
