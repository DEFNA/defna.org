### Introduction

We are looking for assistance with our DjangoCon US website design, and conference swag and art direction.

Our main goal for 2024 [(repo here)](https://github.com/djangocon/2024.djangocon.us) is to update our color scheme, logos, and [style guide](https://2023.djangocon.us/styleguide/) to fit the theme of the host city, which will be announced very soon.

We have all of our 2023 data to work with which includes all of our content along with our speakers and schedule (talks, tutorials, and sprint information) which can be used to verify and test with.

We'd also like your help with our swag and art direction which includes our backdrops during the conference, videos, signage, along with special swag which we give out at the conference.

## Website Overview

In 2017, the DjangoCon US website was re-built using the static site generator Jekyll and hosted on GitHub. 

In 2024, we would like to take it a step further and find an easier to use [Jamstack static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) using Tailwind CSS (current site uses Foundation). As this is not as simple as reusing code as we have in previous years, our Website chair is offering time and assistance towards this goal. 

Our reasons for this include:

* All the same great benefits of Jekyll wouild still apply
* Jekyll can be cumbersome for some non-technical folks to install on their machines and work with
* A Javascript/Typescript/Node/etc based static site generator can be spun up on a Github codespace (or similar) relatively easily
* May be easier for folks to contribute with a more popular and relevant CSS framework


## Landing Page, Website Design, Art Direction Deliverables

DjangoCon US will need:

* A configurable landing page with:
	* City and date information (This should also have a “coming soon” option)
	* A marketing teaser
	* Link to sponsorship info
	* Link to our code of conduct
* Updated website design including city design, color scheme, logos, and updated style guide.
* Ideas and art direction for our swag and signage

### DEFNA Will Provide

* City and date information
* Sponsorship submission form hosted through third-party
* Landing page copy
* The 2023 website which shows a complete and working implementation of what we are looking for
* Technical assistance

## Full Website Deliverable

* Delivery of the full website design
* Responsive design that supports mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
* Accessibility and usability features

DjangoCon US organizers and open-source community members will provide additional support for integration of the design.

## Tentative Schedule

* Website design complete: early March 2024
* Initial site launch: late March 2024
* Swag completion: May 2024
