At DEFNA we know that organizing great events is hard work, and we’d like to give you a little push by encouraging all event organizers in North America, no matter the size, to apply for our grants. The only thing you need to do is fill out [this form](/grants) and the Board will review and answer as soon as possible.

Here’s a recap of the grants given this year:
