### Introduction

We are looking for assistance with our DjangoCon US website design, and conference swag and art direction. 

Our main goal for 2023 [(repo here)](https://github.com/djangocon/2023.djangocon.us) is to update our color scheme, logos, and [style guide](https://2022.djangocon.us/styleguide/) to fit the theme of the new city.

We have all of our 2022 data to work with which includes all of our content along with our speakers and schedule (talks, tutorials, and sprint information) which can be used to verify and test with.

We'd also like your help with our swag and art direction which includes our backdrops during the conference, videos, signage, along with special swag which we give out at the conference.

## Website Overview

In 2017, the DjangoCon US website was re-built using the static site generator Jekyll and hosted on GitHub. While we are not wedded to the use of Jekyll, there are a number of advantages to this static site generator type of approach:

* Much of the website layout code can be reused from year to year
* New designs can be implemented more quickly and easily
* Website documentation is more easily maintained
* The number of contributions and contributors has drastically increased (many contributions can be made through markdown alone)

## Website Technical Specifications

* The 2022 DjangoCon US website currently uses the following software tools:
	* Hosted on Github Pages (using Jekyll static site generator)
	* Foundation responsive design framework
	* Sass CSS extension language
	* Gulp to compile for production
	* npm for installation of front end dependencies

Here is the link to the DjangoCon US 2022 website repo, including README documentation: [https://github.com/djangocon/2022.djangocon.us](https://github.com/djangocon/2022.djangocon.us)

## Landing Page, Website Design, Art Direction Deliverables
