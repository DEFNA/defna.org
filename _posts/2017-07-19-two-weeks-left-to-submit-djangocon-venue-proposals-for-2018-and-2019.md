We wrote to you in May that we are accepting proposals for DjangoCon venues for 2018 and 2019 and that we need your help in making that decision! We are accepting proposals through the end of the month. The deadline is July 31, 2017. 

To recap, here's what you need to know and what we need to know, to consider your proposal:

We are looking at two possible ranges of conference dates: *mid-July through mid-August or late-September (after Yom Kippur) through mid-October*. We need to avoid major holidays like Labor Day and Yom Kippur, the start of the school year, and the busiest summer months.

We’re also considering having the conference location change every two years, instead of every year, to make planning travel easier for our attendees.

We need some information about your city, possible venues, hotels, and travel. Your proposal doesn’t have to be super-fancy, but it does need to be informative. If you are interested in submitting a proposal, please see our [DjangoCon US: Call for Venue Proposal 2018 and 2019](https://www.defna.org/announcements/2017/5/10/djangocon-us-call-for-venue-proposal-2018-and-2019) for more details.
