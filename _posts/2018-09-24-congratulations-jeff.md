Last May the Python Software Foundation released a call for Board Directors, DEFNA’s President Jeff Triplett was nominated by current PSF Board Member Trey Hunner with these words:

>I nominate Jeff Triplett for the PSF Board of Directors. Jeff is passionate about pushing Python spaces to new heights of inclusivity and sustainability. Jeff has given me an enormous amount of actionable feedback in regards to Python/Django community work since nearly the day I met him. Jeff has a tendency to give constructive feedback and to follow through with his words through action.

>Trey Hunner

After a few days of voting on June 25th it was announced that Jeff would become a Board Member for the PSF!

>I have been in total shock and speechless today by this news.
>
>I'm incredibly honored and humbled by your votes and for trusting me to serve on the board of directors for the Python Software Foundation (@ThePSF).
>
>My timeline is full of ❤️. Thank you! 🎉✨ https://t.co/8i6yKUSsGS
