Adam has been Django obsessed for many years and enjoys finding ways to combine Python and Django with GIS, amateur radio and aviation whenever possible. He also has a background in audio visual, control systems and live event production. He has published a number of open source aviation and geographic data related Django apps. He works for JBS Solutions as a Senior Developer. His favorite hobby is flying small airplanes even when there's no place to go.
