title: "Buy your tickets to DjangoCon US 2023!"

[DjangoCon US 2023](https://2023.djangocon.us/) is quickly approaching!

So yes, this is one of those, "get out there and [buy your ticket](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2023)" messages. Our
block rate for the hotel ends Sept 15, so get a move on!Your organizers have been working diligently to prepare for a
fantastic conference this fall. We have amazing keynotes and talks lined up. And [there are tutorials](https://2023.djangocon.us/schedule/#Day-Tutorials) the weekend before
that can be attended from the comfort of your own home. Personally, I could use the refresher on [Postgres optimization](https://2023.djangocon.us/tutorials/seamless-postgres-query-optimization/),
but maybe you're more into [Airflow](https://2023.djangocon.us/tutorials/django-3-airflow/) or [Wagtail](https://2023.djangocon.us/tutorials/best-of-both-worlds-next-js-wagtail/).
Give the whole collection a look and purchase a ticket.

We also have [two days of sprints](https://2023.djangocon.us/sprints/). If you've wanted to be more involved in the Django ecosystem, you'll want to stay for
these. You can learn how to make a code contribution to Django or get started with a third party package. Side note,
when you make a commit to Django, everyone applauds and celebrates. It's the most encouraging way to write open source
software.

Beyond the technical stuff, game night is back! We'll also be having a trivia contest and early morning virtual
co-writing sessions. Who doesn't love going to a conference and then writing a blog post from a hotel room?! As the
organizer of that particular event, I'm going to tell you that it's way more fun than it sounds.
Plus, we all should work on our communication skills (see this post as an example of why you shouldn't let those
skills deteriorate).

See you soon!
