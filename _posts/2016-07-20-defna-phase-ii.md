DEFNA is excited to announce further resources in its work to support the education and outreach of Django. We have established an annual fund to provide grants for local Django events in North America. The purpose of the grants is to allow organizers to increase awareness of their events to attract increased participation, and to be able to obtain the resources needed to put on a successful event. Whether you are doing a one day coding workshop, a half day introductory course, or a Django meet up, let us know what you are doing, and how we can help your event.

To apply for a grant, please send an email to contact (at sign) defna (dot) org with the following information:

Name of event

Date(s) of event

Name(s) of organizer(s)

Purpose of event

Grant amount requested

Purpose of grant

Please put “Request for Django Grant” and include the name of your event in the subject line of your email.

We look forward to furthering our work with the Django community!
