DjangoCon US 2026 needs new branding, art direction, graphic design, website design, conference swag, etc.

### Introduction

Our main goal for 2026 [(repo here)](https://github.com/djangocon/2026.djangocon.us) is to update our 2026 logo/brand, color scheme, illustrations, and [style guide](https://2025.djangocon.us/styleguide/) to fit the theme of our host city, Chicago.

We have all of our 2025 data to work with which includes all of our content along with our speakers and schedule (talks, tutorials, and sprint information) which can be used to verify and test with.

We'd also like your help with our swag and art direction which includes our backdrops during the conference, videos, signage, along with special swag which we give out at the conference.

We are happy to accept proposals from individuals or firms for some or all of the scope listed here, given the breadth of skillsets this project requires. Please note, as a non-profit with limited time, we are most likely to select a proposal that makes this process easy and seamless for us.

## Website Overview

In 2024, we rebuilt the website with 11ty and Tailwind CSS. Our preference would be to also get any web designs implemented in our codebase.

## Full Website Deliverable
