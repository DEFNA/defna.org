The DEFNA board is excited to announce our expansion and the addition of our four new board members. We are excited to see what our new members accomplish. Here is some information about each of them. Please help us in welcoming them!

### HEATHER LUNA

Heather fell in love with Python and Django after DjangoCon US came to Philadelphia in 2016. Her goal is now to combine her love of systems administration with her new love of development. She is committed to furthering and supporting women in technology and supporting diversity and inclusion for all.

### KATHERINE "KATI" MICHEL

She is a project manager, designer, and developer who enjoys following the latest tech trends, learning, and teaching others. In her free time, she enjoys traveling, eating good food, and listening to music.

### KOJO IDRISSA

### MONIQUE MURPHY
Monique started using Django as a developer for the University of Texas at Austin. She is currently a developer for ApplyTexas (also in Austin).
