**Join the DEFNA Board as Corporate Secretary!**

Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA) is seeking a new board member to serve as Corporate Secretary. We have an eight-member board, and one of our board members stepped down. We are looking for someone who is passionate about supporting the DjangoCon US community and can help maintain the organization’s compliance and records.

As Corporate Secretary, your responsibilities will include:

- Preparing and distributing board meeting agendas at least ten days in advance.
- Recording and archiving board meeting minutes for both private and public records.
- Filing the California Annual Statement every odd-numbered year.
- Maintaining corporate compliance records and reporting any changes to corporate information.
- Renewing corporate insurance annually and managing event coverage as needed.
- Ensuring board members sign annual statements and maintain confidentiality agreements.
- Organizing and updating corporate records within Google Drive.
- Tracking and managing key deadlines for filings and renewals.

Board membership typically requires about five hours per month, which includes:

- Attending the monthly board meeting.
- Participating in the grant applications review process.
- Using DEFNA's social media channels to communicate about DEFNA activities.
- Brainstorming new ways for DEFNA to fulfill its mission.

If you're interested in contributing to DEFNA in this role, please reach out to us at [hello@defna.org](mailto\:hello@defna.org) with the following information:

- What interests you about being on the board.
- Your current or prior community involvement (it’s okay if you’re new—we value all perspectives!).
- Any particular interests you have (board meeting organization, compliance tracking, corporate filings, record management, etc.).
- Any ideas for expanding DEFNA’s reach in the open-source community.
- Anything else you’d like us to know about you as a potential board member.

Please email your information to us by March 10 at 12:00 PM ET (Eastern Time)/1600hrs UTC. We'll contact you if we need more details. We'll make our decision and reply to everyone by end-of-day March 20.
