## Outgoing Directors

We would like to take a moment to extend our gratitude to our outgoing directors, Josue Balandrano Coronel and Logan Kilpatrick for their invaluable contributions to our board.

Josue joined DEFNA in 2018, was a DjangoCon US volunteer, and was no stranger to speaking at DjangoCon US. Josue has always been a voice for pushing DEFNA forward and has hosted [our YouTube interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMO4RR5ISRE&list=PL2NFhrDSOxgUwF244g835zO3ciMkKILyJ) for many years.

Logan served for one year on the board, was our DjangoCon US 2022 Conference Chair, and was a valuable member of our organizing team.
