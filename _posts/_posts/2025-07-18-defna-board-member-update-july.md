## Outgoing Directors

We would like to take a moment to extend our gratitude to our outgoing directors, Katherine 'Kati' Michel and Tim Schilling for their invaluable contributions to our board.

### Katherine 'Kati' Michel
We want to express our sincere thanks to Kati Michel for her eight years of service on the DEFNA Board. Since joining in 2017, Kati has been a consistent and thoughtful presence in the community. She served not only as a Director but also as DEFNA’s Secretary at various times.

Kati played a key role in shaping DjangoCon US and DEFNA through her leadership on the Website Committee and her contributions to our overall direction. Her dedication, attention to detail, and commitment to the Django community have left a lasting impression.

Thank you, Kati, for everything you’ve done. We appreciate your service and look forward to staying connected.
