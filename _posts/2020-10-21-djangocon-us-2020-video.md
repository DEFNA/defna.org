---

## We miss you!

2020 is the first time in 12 years DjangoCon US is not being held on a physical or digital stage. However, we want to get together virtually to celebrate our DjangoCon US family. 

From now until October 27 (AoE) we’ll be gathering submissions to reunite our community in a special video. 

How to participate:  
1. Grab your phone or camera and set it to **landscape**.
2. Tell us your favorite thing about DjangoCon US. It could be anything: people, talks, tech, friendships, hallway tracks, sightseeing… you name it!
3. Please keep it **under a minute**.
4. Add your video to: <a class="highlight_link" href="https://bit.ly/31mUHRA" target="_blank">VidHug</a>.  
5. Watch our social media channels for the finished video!
