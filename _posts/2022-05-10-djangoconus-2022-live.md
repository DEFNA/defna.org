We are very excited to announce that the website for DjangoCon US 2022 is [live](https://2022.djangocon.us)! 

The first in-person DjangoCon US conference since 2019 will be from Sunday, October 16th, through Friday, October 21st, 2022.

- October 16: Tutorials ($195 per tutorial)
- October 17, 18, &amp; 19: Talks
- October 20 &amp; 21: Sprints

This year we will be returning to the [Marriott of Mission Valley](https://2022.djangocon.us/venue/) in San Diego, CA. Tickets will be on sale soon, and our [hotel block is already open](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1642551494496&key=GRP).

We are accepting opportunity grant applications through end of day June 10th, 2022 [AoE](https://time.is/compare/0000_10_June_2022_in_Anywhere_on_Earth).

Now is the time to start getting your submissions for talks and tutorials ready because our [call for proposals (CFP)](https://2022.djangocon.us/speaking/) deadline is the end of day on June 10th, 2022 [AoE](https://time.is/compare/0000_10_June_2022_in_Anywhere_on_Earth). As long as it’s still June 10th somewhere in the world, you can submit your proposal or opportunity grant application! 

We invite you to submit your proposal no matter your background or experience level with Django. Proposals can be from a wide range of topics; non-Django and community topics are welcome. You can look at our [talk schedule](https://2021.djangocon.us/talks/) from last year for reference.

We look forward to seeing all of the prospective talks and tutorials!
